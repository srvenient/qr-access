    Asynchronous adapter for `AggregateRootRepository`.

    This class provides asynchronous wrappers for the synchronous methods
    defined in `AggregateRootRepository`, executing them in a separate thread
    using `asyncio.to_thread`. This allows synchronous repository implementations
    to be safely called from asynchronous contexts without blocking the event loop.

    Subclasses should not override these methods unless providing a fully
    asynchronous implementation.
